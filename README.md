<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a course project for CS 253A under Profesor Mr. Indranil Saha related to machine learning algorithm. In this project I implemented an spam Detector Model using SVM(Support Vector Machine) and KNN(K-Nearest Neighbors) Algorithm in python.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* The datasets has been uploaded using [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ozlerhakan/spam-or-not-spam-dataset?resource=download).
* The code outputs the plot for the frequency of different vocabularies used as well as the accuracy of the machine learning model created.


### Prerequisites

*  To run the script files one needs to install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) along with [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/) in their computer.
* Now simply open the Jupyter Notebook and run each code block of the programe.

### Assumptions

* Note that the spam_or_not_spam.csv file should have data in correct format present in it, i.e. each row must contain only 2 column namely email and label with label being either 0 or 1. Thus no empty column should present.
